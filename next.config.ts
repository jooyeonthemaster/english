  // Build-time quality gates, by layer:
  //
  //  - TypeScript: enforced. `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` defaults to
  //    `false` so `next build` fails on any TS error. New code in the
  //    extraction pipeline (src/lib/extraction/**, src/trigger/**,
  //    src/app/api/extraction/**,
  //    src/app/(director)/director/workbench/passages/import/**,
  //    src/hooks/use-extraction-*.ts) is kept TS-clean. The legacy parts
  //    of this codebase use targeted `@ts-nocheck` escape hatches tracked
  //    by their respective owners — we do not touch those here.
  //
  //  - ESLint: **not** a build gate. Next 16 removed the `eslint` field
  //    from NextConfig entirely — `next build` no longer runs ESLint,
  //    regardless of what we set. We run lint separately via
  //    `npm run lint` in CI / pre-commit hooks, and any lint failure in
  //    the extraction-pipeline scope above is treated as a blocker there.
  //    (See also: README / BULK-PASSAGE-EXTRACTION.md.)

  // `pdfjs-dist` (used by the bulk passage extractor on the client) has an
  // optional `canvas` node dependency that we never use in the browser.
  // Tell webpack to treat it as unresolved so the build doesn't look for
  // the native module. `dev --webpack` is set in package.json so we stay
  // on the webpack path.
